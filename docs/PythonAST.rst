Building ASTs with Python
#########################

When we parse a language with some kind of parsing tool, we usually build an :term:`Abstract Syntax Tree`, a data structure representing the document (program) we have processed. Many compilers include their own custom AST package for this purpose. In this note, we wil use a standard Python library, pyTree, to build an AST for reStructuredText documents.
